Scripts to test various cases for ScriptFu subsystem.

Not usually installed.

Should not be localized i18n : for developers only.

## Install

To use, install them:

1. Old style scripts: copy to /scripts.

2. New style independently interpreted scripts:
copy a dir containing the test script into /plugins
and ensure the .scm files have execute permission.

Old style scripts test and are interpreted by extension-script-fu.
When a script crashes extension-script-fu, you must restart Gimp.

New style scripts are interpreted in a separate process
running binary script-fu-interpreter-3.0.

## Invoke

Any installed script can be tested in the SF Console
by just calling it from the PDB: "(script-fu-test-foo)"
since they are PDB procedures.

Scripts that have menu items can be tested from the Gimp GUI.

Any test script can be called by another script.

## Testing framework

test9.scm has a built-in testing framework.

FUTURE: extract the framework to a Scheme extension
that is in the Gimp repo,
that other scripts can load and use.
