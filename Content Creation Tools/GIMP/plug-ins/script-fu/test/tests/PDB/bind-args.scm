; Test ScriptFu's binding to all Gimp C arg types of the PDB


; The PDB procedures called are arbitrary, chosen for the type of their args.

; The test is only that no error is thrown, not necessarily that the call is effective.

; Test binding in both directions: args passed and args returned.

; Testing is not complete, but illustrative of special cases.

; Testing is not blindly exhaustive of every type declarable for PDB procedures.
; Testing is with knowledge of the code.
; Only testing representatives for cases in switch statement of scheme-wrapper.c.
; For example, the code has a case for GObject that covers most subclasses
; of GimpItem, so we only test once, say for GimpLayer.

; Also, we don't test all primitive types.
; We know they are tested drive-by in other tests,
; so we don't necessarily test them here.
; Int, String, Double, UInt

; Note that no PDB procedure takes or returns:
;    gchar (the type for a single character.)
;    GParam or GimpParam
; There is no case in scheme-wrapper.c.



; int
; float

; GimpRGB is tested e.g. with Palette
; GimpRGBArray is tested e.g.
; from palette-get-colormap
; to is not tested: not an arg to any PDB proc

; GStrv string array
; from brushes-get-list
; to file-gih-save or extension-gimp-help
; TODO test GStrv to file-gih-save

; GBytes
; from image-get-colormap
; to image-set-colormap

; FloatArray
; from gimp-context-get-line-dash-pattern
; to gimp-context-set-line-dash-pattern

;                 GimpParasite

; ScriptFu takes and returns a list of attributes of a GimpParasite
; A GimpParasite is a named string having a flags attribute ?
; Also tested elsewhere, many objects can have parasites.
; This tests the global parasites, on the gimp instance.

; to
(assert '(gimp-attach-parasite (list "foo" 1 "zed")))
; from
(assert `(equal? (car (gimp-get-parasite "foo"))
                 '("foo" 1 "zed")))


;                 GimpUnit

; A GimpUnit is both an enum and an object???
; ScriptFu converts to int.  More or less an ID.

; to
; unit index 0 is px
(assert '(string=? (car (gimp-unit-get-abbreviation 0))
