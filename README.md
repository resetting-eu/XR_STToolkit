## STToolkit for AR/VR/MR (XR) based tourism experiences

Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR), XR for brief, have a great potential to transform the ways in which people interact, allowing to build innovative experiences for the visitation of tourism Points of Interest (POIs) and/or substitute for FAM trips during pandemic and post-pandemic times. VR allows exploring new places without physically traveling there, before we decide whether to travel there in real life (i.e., for travel planning). That is the case of virtual tours, which may help decide what to book for the next holidays. Either before we decide on a given destination, or once we get there, there is always an offer of extra trips and excursions to local attractions. VR trips can help to choose where we want to spend our time and money. In other cases, we simply cannot go there, either because the destinations are too remote, too cold, too high, too dangerous, or too expensive. Not to mention visitors with mobility restrictions. AR can also be of great help to a visitor, for instance, providing guidance on top of street map views outdoor, but also improving the visitation of large exhibitions such as fairs or museums, by providing explanations, historical notes, or other contextual information like, for instance, the duration of different itineraries. An example of MR would be combining current and ancient views in archeological sites to create a time-warping effect.
